# This script creates sample data to test the main code.
# It reads JSON files from a folder called 'original', where we expect one
# subfolder per genre:
# - original/blues/trackname.flac.wav.MP3.CBR.64.22050.mp3.1024_512.json
# - original/rock/trackname.flac.wav.WAV.44100.wav.4096_2048.json
#
# Filenames are expected to be in the format used by Dmitry and Juli√°n for the
# ISMIR 2014 paper on robustness (see two examples above).
# The output will be in the format expected by the main code:
# - descriptors/tool/track-length/srate/codec/brate/param1-...-paramN/genre/file
